# oh ya this is a header.
## is this a smaller header?
### an even smaller header!
#### not as small as this one.

###### they sure as hell can be.

I learned how to make headers in a markdown file! The number of pound signs you put before a space and the text correlates with what level on the hierarchy that header should be. Hence, one pound sign = BIG header.
